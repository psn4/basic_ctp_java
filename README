Sample CTP with publishing and subscring via Java

Simple KDB CTP example using a Java injector and subscriber.
Goes without saying this is too slow and not suitable for anything other than demoing and learning! No TP logging etc in this sample.

The following files are not my code, they are copyright of kx systems, see kx.com for copyright notice.

Usage

    Compile the Java files, you'll need 4 shells if not launching as background procs.

        q tick.q -p 5000
    Start the CTP (5001)
        q sub.q
